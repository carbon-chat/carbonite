Carbonite is a ðŸ“– open-source, ðŸª™ free messaging and social media platform as a client for ðŸ’¬ [Carbon](https://github.com/carbon-chat/carbon).

## Our Mission

Our mission is to provide ðŸ”’ secure, and ðŸŽ¯ robust messaging for everyone.

## How it Works

Carbon Clients (like this one) connect to an instance of an [Carbon Server](https://github.com/carbon-chat/carbon-meta). The client uses the [Carbon.js](https://github.com/carbon-chat/carbon.js) library to communicate with the server to send and receive messages, voice and video calls, and more.

## Getting Started

Signup or Login to your Carbon Server at [the Carbonite website](https://carbonite.proplayer919.dev)
